## Objective

DearChat is an anonymous message board style forum where University of Toronto Students and Faculty can converse with eachother in a casual stress-free enviroment. Students and Faculty are free to talk about anything they wish to without judgement or anxiety. DearChat is composed of many sub-forums for various topics. In each sub-forum users of DearChat can either create new threads or contribute to existing threads created by other users. Furthermore, DearChat users can rest assured that they are not identifiable between multiple threads. 

## Key Personas

### Student 

Ava Smolinski is a student from Poland beginning their first year full-time at the University of Toronto St. George Campus. Ava has trouble initiating conversations with fellow others due to language barriers and feels more comfortable conversing under her native language.

### Student 

Joe Mjahmah is a student who lives in Brampton, Ontario and commutes to school through public transportation during his studies. Being socially adept, Joe thrives around others and doesn’t think twice about expressing himself.

### Professor

Bitvik Rhardwaj is a professor who lives in Mississauga, Ontario and commutes to school using his car to reach his workplace. Due to his stern demeanor, he is unable to get accurate feedback from his students during the course evaluation period at the end of terms. 

## Key Scenarios

Ava struggles with English and wishes to find other Polish speakers. She thrives within the introverted lifestyle and enjoys the anonymity of the internet as she has the capabilities to speak her mind to the fullest extent. She wishes to practice her english skills and converse with other UofT students to learn more about Canadian culture.

Joe wishes to spread awareness about issues that effect UofT students and encourage others to take a stand aswell. Joe also wishes to hear from other UofT students about the issues in the community that effect them and have insightful discussions.

Professor Rhardwaj wants to get accurate feedback from his students during the course evaluation period at the end of terms. He wants to know how his students find his style of teaching and whether or not students find his assignments engaging and insightful. He hopes that with a strong feedback loop he further his career as a successful professor.


## Key Principles

Users should rest assured that their identity is 100% anonymous and that not even the person hosting the DearChat instance could trace them back to their UofT email address. 

Users should feel comfortable with the UX design of the Deerchat interface and should be able to easily navigate between sub-forums with ease.

Users should easily be able to create new threads and contribute to existing threads in any sub-forums.

Users should be able to easily keep track of threads they are participating in and be notified when other users respond to them in any active thread they have participated in.

Users are encouraged to create proposals where users can vote upon which sub-forums should be added to DearChat. These sub-forums can be centered around any topic they wish.
