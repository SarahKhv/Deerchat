Release Goals:
- To create a forum that can be used by University of Toronto students. Students can make a proposal to create subforums and create threads. Students can socialize and communicate by commenting in threads. 
- Our release goals include implementing a working model that is easy to use and has no bugs.

The core features that need to be fully built out include;
- Users can sign up using their UofT email and keep track of their account comments, threads and reactions on DeerChat as well as reset their password and log back in once they are logged out.  (DEER-14, DEER-15, DEER-16, DEER-23, DEER-27, DEER-3)

- Users can annonomously create, react and comment on threads that are on a subform, as well as post images. (DEER-4, DEER-5, DEER-6)

- Users can submit proposals for creating subforms, and they can also vote on other users' subform proposals wherein a approval rate of 51% will allow them to create the subform on DeerChat. (DEER-17, DEER-10, DEER-9)

- Users have an easy to use model where they can report any comments they find inappropriate, hide threads they are not interested in, as well as follow threads that they like and monitor responses from other users' to their comments and threads. (DEER-19, DEER-20, DEER-15, DEER-7)
