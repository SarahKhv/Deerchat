# Competition

### Overview:

DeerChat is an anonymous messaging forum exclusively for the students and faculty of the University of Toronto. Signing up therefore requires the user to have a university email. Users can then 'propose' to create a board and a process of voting will decide whether this board will be published or removed. To incentive voting, DeerChat has a points system. Users are awarded points for expressing their opinions on boards, and these points can then be exchanged for stickers, emojis and/or reactions.


### The Competition:

Some of our competitors are forum based platforms like Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/) and the YikYak app (https://yikyak.com/). Similar messaging applications like Discord (https://discord.com/) may also be a competitor.


### How is DeerChat different?

DeerChat stands out from Reddit and Discord due to the its unique moderation system. Unlike these sites, DeerChat has no superuser or admins. The process of moderation is left up to the users through the voting system, wherein a 51 percent vote decides whether the published board, post and/or comment is up to the over-all community standards. YikYak is an app where people can completely anonymously post messages for people in a 5 km radius to read and vote on, but the app's user-base in Canada is low and does not have any systems in place to connect students the way DeerChat has - additionally, YikYak is only supported via a mobile app which makes DeerChat a more accessible option with much more features, i.e, discussion boards, comments, points for voting.


### Who our users are and why they should choose DeerChat:

DeerChat's target audience is students and faculty from universities in Ontario, the anonymity of our service allows users to provide straightforward feedback as well as connect with students from their universities in a way platforms like Reddit or Discord may not fully facilitate. 

For example, an international student at UofT could be looking to make friends who share their first language, DeerChat can facilitate that by connecting these students via language specific boards. On Reddit, this student may have a significantly harder time finding students specifically from UofT as Reddit is open to everyone around the world. Additionally, the student may struggle to find a Discord server that exclusively serves their needs. 

Another user-scenario may be a professor looking for candid feedback on their teaching or looking for a platform where they can directly express their opinions on university matters. With UofT still adjusting policies due to the pandemic, many professors may feel sidelined by the sudden demands placed on them - DeerChat feature of anonymity means anyone and everyone who is part of an organization can have their voices heard, without the fear of unfair repercussion. 


### Can our competitors adapt?

Platforms like Reddit, Discord and YikYak serve a much wider audience, although targeted forums and/or for specific universities exist on these sites, there is no additional verification to ensure users are who they claim to be - this leads to a community which requires external moderation. DeerChat's specilized audience of university members means community moderation works efficiently while also ensuring anonymity. Therefore, although our competitors may seem to serve a similar purpose in the social media scheme, they might not choose to take on DeerChat's more specialized use as it would mean limiting their current user base.
