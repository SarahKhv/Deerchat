**Motivation**
---
DeerChat is a social media platform for university students that allows them to communicate anonymously through forums. These
forums are based on different topics chosen by users. 

DeerChat removes useless and unnecessary subforums through voting. Each subforum topic is proposed and users vote on which forum they would like to see on DeerChat. This voting system gives users power on what they would like to see on DeerChat.

DeerChat gives university students the ability to communicate, socialize and network with students and professors in their university.
