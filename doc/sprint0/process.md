__Process__
---

DeerChat is a team consisting of 7 people who use mutliple platfroms to organize and distribute work. The team meets twice a week for mandatory meetings. There are some optional meetings where the team handles any issues or questions about the project.

__Organization__

The team is organized using a discord server and jira. In the beginning of Sprint 0, we met multiple times to decide on a porject. In the following weeks we met twice per week to distribute the work evenly and discuss any questions regarding the tech stack or the project. All decisions are made using a voting process but any opposing views are taken into consideration.

__Meetings__

The team meets twice a week. Any team member who cannot make it has to infrom the team beforehand and notes are taken for that team memeber. Any issues that arise with the software is taken up with an optional meeting. 

__Decision Making and Story priorities__

All decisions are made by taking all the team memeber's opinions into account. In Sprint 0, the team understood that user stories and their priorities are extremely important for our next sprints. So we used one meeting to decide our product backlog which included our user stories and their priorities. Having a UI design also helped us understand which user stories are necessary to implement.

__Next Phase__

The team had decided that the next phase includes learning new technologies and assigning leads for frontend, backend and database. Team members who have more experience with any of the MERN tech will take the lead. Sprint 1 will include learning new tech as well as working on the frontend and high priority user stories. 
We have learnt from this sprint not to hold back any questions or queries and the importance of distributing tasks early so that every member has enough time to work on their part.
